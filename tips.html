<img src="sunburn.png" style="width:40%"><br><font size="4" face="verdana" color="black">
1. Avoid sunburn / sun tan / dark / black / burned <br>
2. Avoid the angled and old looking skin<br>
3. Avoid pigmentation - Most of the main causes of freckles are not wearing sunscreen<br>
4. Avoid skin cancer<br>

What's the difference between sunblock & sunscreen?
Honestly for me, the taste of the two is the same. Some people say that sunblock against UVB, sunscreen againts UVA and Some also say sunscreen for daily use because he is not sticky, sunblock to go beach because he is sticky and there is white cast. There is also a different word he ingredient, either physical or chemical sunscreen.<br><br>
<br><b>Ingredient in sunscreen or sunblock.</b><br>
<img src="uv.png" style="width:40%"><br><br>
 
-UVA: Aging - PA +++ so that the skin is not aging (looks old, creased, pigmentation)<br>
-UVB: Burning - Wear at least SPF30-50 so that the skin does not burn<br><br>

<br><b>How much do we need to apply sunscreen or sunblock?</b><br>
<img src="sunscreen.png" style="width:40%"><br>should wear a lot like the picture above for maximum protection.<br><br>


<font size="5" face="verdana" color="black" ><b>Reasons Wearing Sunscreen is Important</b></font><br>

<b>1. It decreases your risk of developing deadly cancer.</b><br>
Using sunscreen daily, even when it is cloudy or raining, dramatically decreases your risk of developing skin cancer. This is especially true of the deadliest form, melanoma, which is responsible for 75% of all skin cancer deaths in Iowa.<br>

<b>2. It keeps you looking young.</b><br>
Did you know the number-one cause of premature aging of the face is ultraviolet exposure? By wearing sunscreen, you are slowing down the development of wrinkles and leathery skin.<br>

<b>3. Sunscreen keeps your skin tone even.</b><br>
In addition to slowing aging of the skin, sunscreen prevents facial brown spots and skin discolorations.<br>

<b>4. Sunscreen is important for all skin types.</b><br>
Even if you don’t burn easily, wearing sunscreen is still important. Sunburn is an immediate reaction, but sun damage occurs over a lifetime. Although skin cancer is more prevalent in people with lighter skin, it does not discriminate and can still affect those with darker skin.<br>

<b>5. Sunscreen protects you from more than sunburn.</b><br>
If you have ever had sunburn, you understand just how unpleasant red, burning skin can be. Heatstroke and heat exhaustion are two other extremely nasty health issues that can arise from extended sun exposure. Sunscreen, in combination with other precautions such as increased consumption of water, can help you avoid these issues, which can lead to nausea, muscle cramps and even brain damage if left untreated.<br>

	Cleansing is a vital skincare step for those with acne-prone skin. However, it’s very likely that people tend to over-cleanse, which could be counterproductive. This will cause even more oil to be produced, leading to more breakouts.

The right approach: Maintain your daily skincare routine as usual and wash your face twice a day, only in the morning and evening. At the same time, do remember to keep your cleansers gentle.<br>
<br><img src="acne5.png" style="width:40%"><br>
	<b>4. Popping pimples</b><br>
Can’t help popping pimples every time they show up on your face unwelcome? Think twice before you do so since infected materials can get pushed into the skin, raising the risk of inflammation and scarring.

The right approach: Use acne remedies that work for you. If blemishes are not cleared up, go to a dermatologist to avoid causing even more breakouts.<br>

<img src="brek1.png" style="width:70%"><br><font size="4" face="verdana" color="black"><br><br>
	In recent years, skin fasting become a hot topic among girls. Instead of using too much skincare and cosmetics products, we should let our skin to restore and renew itself. However, the efficacy of this method is very controversial. Do you want to try? It is better to understand the principle and how to do it before deciding whether to start or not!<br><br>

	<br><img src="brek2.png" style="width:40%"><br>
	<b>1.  Wash only with water/pure soap</b><br>
	The theory of skin fasting suggests that frequent face washing can cause the skin to be too dry and damage the surface of the skin, destroying the surface self-protection, and it will cause fine lines and slack. It is recommended not to use facial cleansing products, just wash your face with clean water and pure soap without surfactant gently.<br>

<br><img src="brek3.png" style="width:40%"><br>
	<b>2. Do not apply toner</b><br>
	The skin fasting theory believes that the main component of toner is water, when the water evaporates on the skin, between the cells will crack and make the skin drier.
<br>
<br><img src="brek4.png" style="width:40%"><br>
	<b>3. Apply only a small amount of Vaseline for moisturizing</b><br>
	Do not use functional chemicals such as whitening, anti-aging, wrinkle removal, etc., just pay attention on simple cleaning and moisturizing. If your skin feels dry, apply a small amount of Vaseline. Because Vaseline is not oxidized, other creams and vegetable oils are easily oxidized and have the potential to cause harmful substances after oxidation.<br>

<br><img src="brek5.png" style="width:40%"><br>
	<b>4. Reduce sunscreen</b><br>
	Because sunscreen products contain a lot of chemicals, doctors do not advocate the use of sunscreen products, he believes that the absorption of the right amount of ultraviolet light can make the skin health. If you are not exposed to the sun for a short period of time, you can use physical sun protection, like hat/face towel.
<br>

<br><img src="brek6.png" style="width:40%"><br>
	<b>5.  No blackhead stickers</b><br>
	The blackheads are old wastes formed by the exfoliation of keratinocytes. The clear blackhead paste can immediately remove the pimples, but it will cause internal damage to the pores. In order to recover the wound, the stratum corneum will be thicken, causing skin problem of large pores.
<br><br>
Are you suitable for skin fasting?

Therefore, before you start, it is recommended you should ask the dermatologist or check your skin adaptation level for three to seven days. If the result is too bad, it is recommended to try “intermediate skin fasting”, that is, only apply skin fasting 1-2 days a week to let your skin to have enough time to take a rest.<br>
