   <td><b>DRY SKIN</b> is an uncomfortable condition marked by scaling, itching, and cracking. It can occur for a variety of reasons. You might have naturally dry skin. But even if your skin tends to be oily, you can develop dry skin from time to time.<br> <h3><u><b>Types of dry skin</b></u></h3>
Exposure to dry weather conditions, hot water, and certain chemicals can cause your skin to dry out. Dry skin can also result from underlying medical conditions.<br><br>
<h3><u><b>Risk factors for dry skin</b></u></h3>
Dry skin can affect anyone. But some risk factors raise your chances of developing dry skin, including:<br>

<br><b>1. Age.</b> <br> Older adults are more likely to develop dry skin. As you age, your pores naturally produce less oil, raising your risk of dry skin.
<br><b>2.Medical history.</b><br> You’re more likely to experience eczema or allergic contact dermatitis if you have a history of these conditions or other allergic diseases in your family.
<br><b>3.Season.</b><br> Dry skin is more common during the fall and winter months, when humidity levels are relatively low. In the summer, higher levels of humidity help stop your skin from drying out.
<br><b>4.Bathing habits.</b><br> Taking frequent baths or washing with very hot water raises your risk of dry skin.

   <td><b>OILY SKIN</b> is acne-prone skin with open pores, a shiny complexion, blackheads, and pimples. Because hormones affect oil production, anything that changes your hormone levels may affect your skin.
 <br> <h3><u><b>Types of oily skin</b></u></h3>
  There are in some areas and oily in others, such as the T-zone (nose, forehead, and chin). Many people have this type. It may need slightly different care in different areas.
<br> <h3><u><b>Risk factors for oily skin</b></u></h3>
<br><b>1.Sebum</b><br>
Too much sebum, however, may lead to oily skin, which can lead to clogged pores and acne. Genetics, hormone changes, or even stress may increase sebum production.
<br><b>2.Enlarged pores</b><br>
Sometimes your pores can stretch out due to age, weight fluctuations, and previous breakouts. Larger pores also tend to produce more oil.
You can’t shrink your pores, but you can take extra care to blot areas of your face with enlarged pores throughout the day.
<br><b>3.Overdoing your skin care routine</b><br>
On the flip side, washing your face or exfoliating too often can also make your skin oily. This can seem like an oxymoron, since the purpose of washing and exfoliating is to get rid of oil.
But if you do this too often, you strip away too much of the oil from your skin. 
<br><b>4.Skipping your moisturizer</b><br>
It’s a myth that moisturizer causes oily skin. In fact, if you’re using acne treatments such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, you definitely need a good moisturizer to keep your skin from drying out. Without moisturizer, any skin type will dry out.<br>

   <td><b>NORMAL SKIN</b> can be very hard to define normal skin types and characteristics, as they are made up of a degree of expectations. When it comes to normal skin, the individual generally doesn’t describe their skin as oily or dry. When oiliness and dryness are present, it’s rare and tends to be easy to get rid of or resolve. When it comes to pore size, normal skin types feature small pores that are not engorged or easily visible. Normal skin doesn’t normally have a great excess of shine, and it also doesn’t tend to be cracked or flaky. Normal skin types usually exhibit few lines and wrinkles, and the skin’s tone is generally even, with no marked blemishes.
   <br> <h3><u><b>Types of normal skin</b></u></h3>
   Not too dry and not too oily, normal skin has no or few imperfections, no severe sensitivity,barely visible pores and radiant complexion.</td>

   <td><b>SENSITIVE SKIN</b> refers to a range of conditions, from genetic ailments, such as rosacea and eczema, to severe allergies. While many people can have a skin reaction at some point or another to a product or ingredient, those with persistent issues are classified as having sensitive skin.
    <br> <h3><u><b>Types of sensitive skin</b></u></h3>
    Those who have sensitive skin all report similar symptoms: redness, irritation, inflammation and the general feeling that their skin is “one size too small.” But the underlying cause of such reactions is varied—and identifying the cause of the sensitivity plays the biggest role in honing in on how to treat the skin. 
    <br> <h3><u><b>Risk factors for sensitive skin</b></u></h3>
    <br><b>1. Allergic contact dermatitis</b><br>
     Allergic contact dermatitis is a less common form of contact dermatitis. It occurs when you have an allergic reaction to a specific substance.<br>

		Symptoms include:<br>

		-redness<br>
		-itchiness<br>
		-blisters and bumps, sometimes containing fluid<br>
		-burning.

	<br><b>2.Eczema</b><br>
Eczema (atopic dermatitis) affects your skin’s ability to protect you from irritants, like germs in the air or chemicals in your laundry detergent. This can make you extra sensitive to products that don’t bother other people, like soaps and cosmetics.

<br><b>3.Weather</b><br>
One of the principal causes of dry and sensitive skin is the weather and general climate, with the changing of each season.
In general, our skin tends to be happier and healthier in the summer. This is down to a number of factors, but is primarily due to increased contact with the sun, meaning higher levels of vitamins, being in a better mood and being more active.
